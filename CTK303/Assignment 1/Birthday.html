            For the week of March 14, 2005, the #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 was "Candy Shop" by 50 Cent featuring Olivia.

            <p class="img-text">
            For the week ending March 14, 2025, I found that Chappell Roan's "Pink Pony Club" was a major contender for the top spot, though some sources show Kendrick Lamar & SZA's "Luther" or other hits like Billie Eilish's "Birds of a Feather" also prominent around that time.
